## 🛠️ Tools and Platforms Used

Here’s a list of the main tools and platforms I used throughout the WALL·E project:

- **Fusion 360** – Designed 3D parts of the robot and exported STL files for 3D printing.
- **Fritzing** – Simulated circuits and verified wiring before building the physical prototype.
- **EasyEDA** – Created circuit schematics and organized the wiring logic.
- **Arduino IDE** – Developed and uploaded code to the ESP32 microcontroller.
- **OrcaSlicer** – Used slicing all my 3d printabled parts.
